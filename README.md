# Spaceman

A classic game in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's an app for players to play the classic game of spaceman by entering a word and having another player guess each letter of that word. Two, or more, players can play with the first player entering a secret word or phrase and the rest of the players making guesses on letters that are in that word or phrase. For every correct guess the letter will appear. For every incorrect guess the spaceman and his ship will start to appear until they are fully formed and blast off! A timer will be set after the word or phrase is decided and the players will have to race against the clock. The faster you guess the correct word, the higher your score. As a couple of stretch goals I would like to add customization options to the spaceman/ship and have computer generated words and phrases from categories so the player can play alone or with all players taking guesses.
